Learn more. </p> <p> <span> Download Video Editor x32</span> </p> <p> <span> Download Video Editor x64</span> </p> ¬† <p> <strong> Non-linear video editor</strong> <br/> Our editor is a non-linear tool. This means that unlike in most other editors, where scenes come one after another in a linear sequence and certain order, our software allows objects to be placed in any position on the timeline and have any size. Besides, various parameters, shape and position of objects can change arbitrarily over time.</p> <p> <strong> Visual and audio effects</strong> <br/> You can apply various visual and audio effects to your videos to achieve the necessary result. Since the number of available visual effect is very high, they are split into five categories for ease of navigation: color correction, object transformation, object filters, transition effects and special fx.</p> <p> <strong> Blending modes and Instagram-like filters</strong> <br/> One more way of changing the look of your video image according to your preferences is color blending. Using a wide array of adjustable parameters, you can attach a unique professional style to your video. Newbies or those, who would like to save time, can benefit from stylish Instagram-like filters applied in one click.</p> <p> <strong> Masking</strong> <br/> VSDC Free Video Editor allows for creating different shaped masks for hiding, blurring or highlighting certain elements in your video. You can use it to apply special effects inside or outside the masked area. One of the most common reasons for masking are to blur a face to protect the identity or remove unwanted marks.</p> <p> <strong> Motion tracking</strong> <br/> The Motion tracking tool allows for registering and tracking movements of any objects in a video and then assigns the resulted trajectory to other elements ‚Äì titles, captions, icons, images, masks, and more. With its help, placing a censorship mask on a moving object or making captions follow a selected element in a video becomes easy.</p> <p> <strong> Easy export to social networks</strong> <br/> To prepare a video for Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Vimeo without any problems, VSDC Free Video Editor offers you special export profiles which significantly reduce the stress of selecting a suitable format and meeting all the requirements.</p> <p> <strong> Subpixel accuracy</strong> <br/> Objects in a scene are positioned with subpixel accuracy, which makes for smooth animation, rotation, transformation and precise relative positioning.</p> <p> <strong> Support of popular formats</strong> <br/> Our software supports virtually all video, image and audio formats and codecs. That is why you won‚Äôt need any additional conversion tools to edit your files, as is often the case with other programs.</p> <p> <strong> 4K and HD export</strong> <br/> VSDC is currently the only free video editor that allows you to export in a new H265/HEVC codec to maintain the highest quality at a minimum file size which is essential for those often processing 4K and HD files.</p> <p> <strong> Creation of videos for specific multimedia devices</strong> <br/> Thanks to a large set of preconfigured profiles, you can easily create videos for most popular multimedia devices, such as DVD players, iPod/iPhone/iPad, PSP, Galaxy, any smartphones and regular phones, Sony PlayStation, Xbox, Zune, Archos, iRiver, Creative Zen, Blackberry, MP4 players and many others.</p> <p> <strong> Working with charts</strong> <br/> You can create diagrams of different kinds, including 3D diagrams: Bar, Stacked Bar, Point, Bubble, Line, Scatter Line, Fast Line, Step Line, Spline, Area, Spline Area, Stacked Area, Stacked Spline Area, Range Bar, Gantt, Pie, Pie 3D, Torus 3D, Radar Point, Radar Line, Radar Area, Radar Spline, Radar Spline Area, Funnel, Pyramid, Pyramid 3D, High Low, Candle Stick. These objects can be based on dynamically changing data of different types. Besides, the appearance of diagrams is fully customizable (appearance of charts, coordinate axes, user-defined axes, legends, names of charts and axes, lines, labels and other elements), which will help you tailor them to your specific needs. Integrated color themes make it possible to quickly change the way your charts look.</p> <p> <strong> Video library (to be included in the next program release)</strong> <br/> The editor software lets you create your own library of multimedia files with brief or detailed descriptions. This will help you organize your video collection and simplify access to the necessary files.</p> <p> <strong> Video stabilization tool</strong> <br/> Footage taken from drones, action cameras or other devices on the go often needs improvement. VSDC Stabilization tool, as your virtual tripod, helps remove jitter or any other shaking effects, caused by camera movement and turn it into a much smoother video image.</p> <p> <strong> YouTube uploader</strong> <br/> VSDC Free Video Editor not only provides ready-made profiles for exporting to social networks, but also offers you to upload your video directly to YouTube right from the app without switching windows or tabs.</p> <p> <strong> Built-in DVD burning tool</strong> <br/> The editor comes with a DVD burning tool, allowing you to easily burn the results of your work to optical discs.</p> <p> <strong> Video File Converter</strong> <br/> The application is designed to quickly convert video files from one format to another. It has some basic features for editing videos: removing unneeded segments, splitting your video into parts, and merging several files into one.</p> <p> <strong> Desktop video capture</strong> <br/> The video editor features a desktop video capture utility that saves captured footage to a video file for subsequent processing in the editor.</p> <p> <strong> Video capturing</strong> <br/> Another feature of the our editor is the ability to capture video from various video tuners, webcams, IP —Åameras and save the captured footage on your computer in an arbitrary format for subsequent editing.</p> <p> <span> Download Video Editor x32</span> </p> <p> <span> Download Video Editor x64</span> </p> ¬† How to use Video Editor System requirements Supported formats and codecs Description for Editors Top-rated Video Editor's reviews Artificial Intelligence Art Generator <p> </p> <h2> Editor's Screenshots</h2> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h3> List of changes</h3> <p> <strong> Version 6.5.1</strong> </p> The Lens flare effect, imitating a strong source of light, added to the ‚ÄúOpen GL‚Äù category of the video effects menu.

System clipboard processing added - an option to insert images from the clipboard, as well as video/audio/image files from the links copied to the clipboard. <p> <strong> Version 5.1.2</strong> </p> Enhanced text editing: support for all common letter types and fonts, various character encoding more flexible text introduction ‚Äì users can enter a text right on the editor‚Äôs stage in an automatically adjustable block ability to set properties for each character separately H265/HEVC hardware acceleration Interface localization into Spanish <p> <strong> Version 5.0.1</strong> </p> Program‚Äôs interface complete restyling ‚Äì switching to a modern flat design H264 codec hardware acceleration Adjustable parameters settings for pro editing ‚Äì creating curved motion paths for video objects or animation Optimized advanced multi-color Chroma Key Adding the H265/HEVC codec as an import format <p> <strong> Version 4.0.1</strong> </p> Filters, decoders and coders were optimized. Performance of many codecs, for example H264, was increased by more than 50%. We added a new opportunity to set zooming quality when working with images as well as to launch multiprocessing and separate coding, decoding, recording and reading processes for faster performance. APNG and GIF formats were added. The both formats enable to create videos with semi-transparence effect so that one can implement animation effects on web-sites. Quality of coded image was significantly enhanced due to dithering effect. We added compression option for SWF and GIF files which enables to significantly reduce their size. Audio format FLAC was added to enable work with audio materials without any loss of quality. We added support of 2K and 4K video as well as the opportunity to open files with H265/HEVC codec and Iphone Live Photos. Information about an author of a video, a publisher, copyright info and other data can now be recorded directly to the resulting video file. Enhanced usability of the Editor: the program saves current format and profile during exportation; we added the opportunity to set not only the argument value, but also the time period during which the parameter will take this value; new additional settings were implemented. The following errors were corrected: several languages didn‚Äôt support subtitles; animation object improved: number of images which could be open at once is no more limited; auto titling error was corrected: a resulting file was automatically titled using incorrect symbols thus making project export impossible; duplicate error was corrected: use of threads made the application finish its work incorrectly; welcome page error in local versions: we included a welcome page with all recent updates; Italian translation was improved. <p> <strong> Version 3.3.5</strong> </p> A new object has been added: a chart that allows you to build diagrams. A large number of various kinds of diagrams are supported, including 3D diagrams: Bar, Stacked Bar, Point, Bubble, Line, Scatter Line, Fast Line, Step Line, Spline, Area, Spline Area, Stacked Area, Stacked Spline Area, Range Bar, Gantt, Pie, Pie 3D, Torus 3D, Radar Point, Radar Line, Radar Area, Radar Spline, Radar Spline Area, Funnel, Pyramid, Pyramid 3D, High Low, Candle Stick.<br/> Key features of the diagram: You can change displayed data sets and their values, which allows you to create dynamic diagrams that change over time Create several graphs in a single diagram or various diagrams (combined by context) Import and export data to and from Excel The diagram's appearance is customizable - the chart itself, the axes of the coordinates (including user axes), legends, names of graphs and axes, layout lines, markers on axes, and other elements Completely fine-tune the color schemes used to create graphs, or use preset color schemes Effects have been added that allow you to change the tempo, speed, and pitch of the sounds being played, or play them in reverse. As a result, you can now play audio when reversing or rewinding videos. Group operations have been improved - the order in which assets are selected in the editor during group operations is now tracked. All application settings are now grouped together in the same place, which has made it possible to simply controlling the application and add additional functions such as auto-save and backup. The interface has been improved: the menus have been expanded and unified, and new menus have been added. <p> <strong> Version 3.3.0</strong> </p> The way sprites are drawn has been improved. You can now combine drawing objects on a sprite with effects applied to the sprite. The editor is now easier to use: a function has been added that allows you to turn an object into a sprite the menus have been improved and now have greater functionality you can now split a video into two separate objects: audio and video the visual editor for parameters has been improved: in the editor you can now display any object parameters in the background, as well as switch quickly between the parameters you want to edit. This makes it easier to edit parameters that are mutually dependent you can now adjust the scale of parameters on a parameter value bar, which allows you to set the values of parameters more precisely You can now regulate volume by entering a percentage of the maximum potential volume. The regulating effect can apply to outgoing content as well as content that already has audio filters applied to it. The Threshold effect has been significantly improved. The effect now has various modes and works with the alpha channel The Reducing Bits effect has been added, which allows you to reduce the number of colors in the object being displayed The Special effects group now has a TV Effects subgroup: AgingTV: the colors look washed-out, and there are scratches, dust, and cracks. The default effects from the "Old Film" group have also been improved Broken TV: this effect emulates a TV with a shaky picture Random Dot Stereo TV: this effect emulates a TV with stereo interference Noise TV: this effect emulates TV interference (noise) Italian and Japanese have been added <p> <strong> Version 3.2.0</strong> </p> Added the display of waveforms for video and audio objects, which allows users to edit videos on the basis of audio data (for example, cut out periods of silence). Waveforms can also be shown for audio effects. This makes it possible to precisely apply effects to the necessary fragment of a video or audio object. All parameters of audio effects can be edited in a visual editor, which enables users to make changes easier and faster. Improved a volume change effect. Volume can now change arbitrarily along a straight or curved line, or their combination (part of the Volume effect changes along a curve, part along a straight line). <p> <strong> Version 3.1.0</strong> </p> Changes in the license agreement ‚Äì the product can now be used for commercial purposes. Editing of non-linear object parameters has been moved to the main timeline, which helped unify and simplify the interface. Besides, the change trajectory of non-linear parameters can now consist of several paths that can be both curved and straight. All static object properties can now be edited in a visual editor, which is easier and more intuitive than entering the values manually. Editing of video and audio files has become more flexible and convenient. Removal and recovery of removed areas became possible not just with the help of an assistant, but also on the main timeline, which speeds up the editing process. Fixed bugs that resulted in program termination. Also fixed a bug that occasionally caused issues when certain fragments were removed from a video. <p> <strong> Version 3.0.0</strong> </p> <p> All parameters that used to be changed linearly can now change their values along a curve:</p> Added a parameter modification editor. Added curve templates to the parameter modification editor. <p> The new version features an all-new principle of managing object/effect parameters. These parameters could previously have a constant value only or change linearly from the start of an effect till its completion. From now on, they can change randomly in the course of an effect.In many cases, it helps remove unnecessary objects from the timeline, increase the usability and reduce the time needed for creating a project.</p> <p> Besides, parameters can now change their values not just linearly, but along a curve as well, which will help create more complex and beautiful effects.</p> <p> This means that starting from this version, the editor became completely non-linear.</p> <p> <strong> Version 2.3.1</strong> </p> Fixed a bug that could result in the duration of a video or audio object being set incorrectly after removing certain fragments from them. <p> <strong> Version 2.3.0</strong> </p> The editor now features 3 new tools:<br/> - a video converter that has its own set of profiles (conversion settings) that is different from those of the editor and is optimized for converting files from one format to another;<br/> - a disc burning tool. You can now not only burn projects created in the editor, but use the tool for general purposes;<br/> - a video download tool ‚Äì allows you to grab videos from various video services. Improved wizard:<br/> - added the support of batch file processing;<br/> - improved thumbnail visualization (thumbnails now show the effects applied to images);<br/> - added a possibility to apply effect templates to files (so-called ‚Äúquick styles‚Äù) Improved the work of color correction filters by 40% thanks to optimization for new processors, and the work of the image resize function: the speed of the cubic and supersampling methods for resize effect has been increased by 300-400% using new algorithms; also added a resize method based on Lanczos resampling; Optimized memory management; Added multi-threading support to the scene creation process ‚Äì the preview of complex scenes is now smoother on CPU‚Äôs with 2 and more cores, and conversion speed can be up to 50-100% higher on CPU‚Äôs with 4+ cores; Added the following filters: AutoGamma (automatic gamma correction), AutoGammaInv (restores the original gamma values after the use of the AutoGamma filter), Median (median filter), DeNoise (noise reduction based on the Wiener filter ‚Äì applies adaptive filtering to images containing uniform noise). <p> <strong> Version 2.2.2</strong> </p> You can now create videos with semitransparency. Codecs have been added that support semitransparency (PNG, lossless JPEG) and the GIF format; An internet profile category has been added with the MP4, FLV, SWF, and GIF formats; "Quick Styles" have been added. Quick Styles allow you to apply the most frequently used effects to the videos you have created; Support has been added for SRT subtitles, which allows you to enter textual messages using a special scripting language; The speed of the algorithms for rendering translucent objects has been doubled thanks to support for SSE2 technology; It is now easier to work with a timeline -- you can copy objects within the timeline itself, and support for a drag-and-drop interface has been added. <p> <strong> Version 2.2.0</strong> </p> The ability to create an animation out of a number of images has been added; Video playback during previews and conversion speed have been increased; Minor bugs have been fixed. <p> <strong> Version 2.1.9</strong> </p> Changed object rendering on a scene. Objects are now rendered with sub-pixel accuracy, which makes it possible to create smooth object animations; Completely reworked the motion configuration principle, which now uses trajectories, not intervals. Added different types of motion, including accelerated motion; Reworked profiles for exporting projects to video formats. Added the support of profiles for HD and high frame rate videos. <p> <strong> Version 2.1.8</strong> </p> Added a possibility to apply filters in the Wizard; Added a possibility to edit objects in the Wizard; Improved the usability of the Wizard; Increased the speed of export for some project configurations; Lowered memory requirements for very large projects; Reworked the timeline ‚Äì added more control elements; Added animated GIF support; Added a possibility to associate project files with an application; Fixed minor bugs. <p> <strong> Version 2.1.5</strong> </p> The timeline has been reworked and updated with additional control elements; Video processing and project conversion speed has been increased; the preview function now works smoother; Fixed a number of minor bugs. <p> <strong> Version 2.1.1</strong> </p> Added the support of animated semi-transparent GIF images; Added the support of video files with semi-transparency (Photo PNG and JPEG2000 with Alpha); Memory requirements have been considerably lowered; Video capturing and recording utilities have been updated; It is now possible to use looped videos for video objects; Minor bugs fixed. <p> <strong> Version 2.0.1</strong> </p> <p> The update features a number of filters and sound effects. Added 4 groups of sound effects:</p> Amplitude correction: Fade-In, Fade-Out, Volume; Sound delay effects: Flanger, Chorus, Delay, Phaser, Vibrato, Reverberation; Various audio filters: LowPass, HiPass, Notch, BandPass, LowShelf, HiShelf, Peaking EQ, Wah-Wah; Special effects: Silence, Invert. <p> This version supports automatic creation of a project backup after every recording and monitoring of the integrity of the most recently saved project copy, allowing the user to roll back to it when necessary.</p> <p> ¬†</p> <h3> end faq</h3> <p> <span> Reviewed by</span> </p> <br/> <p> "VSDC Free Video Editor is a surprisingly powerful, if unconventional video editor"</p> <p> - PC Advisor </p> <br/> <p> "This video editor gives you tons of control and editing power"</p> <p> - CNet </p> <br/> <p> "The editor handles many common formats and boasts a good deal of capabilities when it comes time to alter lighting, splice video, and apply filters and transitions in post production"</p> <p> - Digital Trends </p> <strong> Like us</strong> on Facebook <br/> <strong> Follow us</strong> on Twitter <br/> <strong> Watch us</strong> on YouTube <p> ¬© 2011-2020, www.videosoftdev.com , Multilab LLC designed by Khapov Privacy policy | Terms of use | About us <br/> All trademarks referenced herein are the sole property of their respective owners.</p> <p> <span> Copying any materials from this site allowed only with written consent of Site Administration.</span> </p><br>
