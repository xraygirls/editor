Click the <strong> Export</strong> button. Select a folder to save the video project as a <strong> .mp4</strong> file. <p> Click the <strong> Export</strong> button.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Once you complete the steps, the video will be created and exported, and you can now play it with any device that supports MP4 playback. Or you can share it with anyone using email, social media, or you can even upload it to YouTube for the world to see your creation.</p> <p> </p> <h2> How to create video project manually using Photos</h2> <p> To create a video project from scratch using the Photos app, use these steps:</p> Open <strong> Photos</strong> . <p> Click the <strong> Video Editor</strong> tab.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Click the <strong> New video project</strong> button.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Specify a descriptive name for the project. Click the <strong> OK</strong> button. <p> After you complete the steps, you can start adding content to the storyboard to continue editing the project with various options, including text, duration, motion, 3D effects, and more. The video editor also has a live preview that you can use to check the process before exporting the video.</p> <p> </p> <h2> How to edit video project using Photos</h2> <p> Once you created a new project, you'll be presented with the video editor experience, which is made up of three main sections. You have the "Project library" at the top-left side, which is the place where you'll add the images and videos that you'll be using in the project.</p> <p> At the bottom, you'll find the "Storyboard" section, which is where you can drag and drop the media elements to build your video. Also, depending on the content you're editing, you'll get a different set of features you can use to edit.</p> <p> On the top-right side, you can preview your project with all the current changes, and as you play the video, you'll see the timeline highlighting the card being played.</p> <h3> Adding media elements</h3> <p> To add new media files to the video project, use these steps:</p> Under the "Project Library" section, click the <strong> Add</strong> button in the top-left corner. <p> Select the <strong> From my collection</strong> option.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> <strong> Quick note:</strong> The video editor also allows you to import files that are not part of the Photos app, such as from an external drive, using the "From this PC" option, and you can even use the "From the web" option to download images from Bing.</p> Select the pictures and videos you want to be part of the project. <p> Click the <strong> Add</strong> button from the top-right corner.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Check the media elements to begin your video. <p> Click the <strong> Place in storyboard</strong> button. (You can also drag-and-drop the files to the storyboard.)</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> While editing a video, you can always add more media files, clicking the <strong> Add</strong> button, and you can remove files by selecting the items and clicking the <strong> Trash</strong> button from the top-right.</p> <h3> Adding duration</h3> <p> As you add media to the storyboard, you'll notice that every file includes a default time duration. If you want the media to have a shorter or longer period, use these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the media element (or elements). Click the <strong> Duration</strong> button from the toolbar. <p> Select a time duration, or specify a time range in seconds.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> After you complete the steps, the element will play in the video the time you specified. If you have multiple elements in the storyboard, you may need to repeat the steps to change the duration for the remaining items.</p> <h3> Adding text</h3> <p> You can also add a custom title or caption to an image or video using these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the media element. <p> Click the <strong> Text</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Use the <strong> Text</strong> box to insert custom text.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Select the text style from the list. Select the location using the <strong> Layout</strong> options. Use the controls on the left side to specify the text duration and preview the changes. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> Once you complete the steps, the text will apply to the element for the time you specified.</p> <h3> Adding motion</h3> <p> The video editor in Photos also lets you add camera motion styles to images and videos with these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the media element. <p> Click the <strong> Motion</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Select a motion effect for the image or video, such as <strong> Zoom in center</strong> , <strong> Zoom in right</strong> , <strong> Pan left</strong> , <strong> Tilt up</strong> and others.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Use the controls on the left side to preview the changes. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> After you complete the steps, you may need to repeat the steps to apply the same or different motion effect to other parts of the video.</p> <h3> Adding filters</h3> <p> Using the video editor, you can even add filters to change the look of the images or video clips in your project using these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the media element. <p> Click the <strong> Filters</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Select one of the 14 filters available, such as <strong> Classic</strong> , <strong> Adventure</strong> , <strong> Sepia</strong> , <strong> Inky</strong> , <strong> Loved</strong> , <strong> Pixel</strong> , etc.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Use the controls on the left side to preview the changes. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> After you complete the steps, the filter will apply for the media file. If you have multiple parts of the project to use a specific filter, you'll need to repeat the steps for each element.</p> <h3> Adding trim, split, speed</h3> <p> The Photos app editor also includes the ability to trim, split, and control the speed of a video clip.</p> <h4> Trimming</h4> <p> To trim a video with the Photos app editor, use these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the video clip. <p> Click the <strong> Trim</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Use the controls to choose the trim section.</p> <p> <strong> Quick tip:</strong> When inserting a video clip to the storyboard, it'll not play the full length. If you want to include the entire video, you need to select the whole length using the trim option.</p> Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> Once you complete the steps, only the video selection you specified will be included in the project.</p> <h4> Splitting</h4> <p> To split a video clip into two or more parts with the Photos app, use these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the video clip. <p> Click the <strong> Split</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Use the slider to choose the length of the clip.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Click the <strong> Done</strong> button.</p> <p> <strong> Quick tip:</strong> If you want to split the video in multiple clips, repeat <strong> steps No. 5</strong> through <strong> 7</strong> .</p> <p> After you complete the steps, you'll end up with a video divided into multiple parts. (This option will not modify the original video.)</p> <h4> Speeding</h4> <p> To slow down or speed up a video clip in the storyboard, use these steps:</p> Under the "Storyboard" section, select the video clip. <p> Click the <strong> Speed</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Use the slider to choose the speed of the clip. <p> Once you complete the steps, the video will play using the speed you selected.</p> <h3> Adding title cards</h3> <p> While working on a video project, adding a title or custom text with a background is an excellent way to break the video into sections or mark a change in the scene.</p> <p> To add title cards to a video project in the Photos app, use these steps:</p> <p> Under the "Storyboard" section, click the <strong> Add title card</strong> button.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Click, hold, and drag the card to the location you want to show it. <p> Select the title card to focus and reveal the options.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> <strong> Quick tip:</strong> You can always right-click the card to see the available options.</p> <p> Click the <strong> Text</strong> button from the toolbar.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Use the <strong> Text</strong> box to insert custom text.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Select the text style from the list. Select the location using the <strong> Layout</strong> options. Use the controls on the left side to specify the text duration and preview the changes. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. (Optional) Click the <strong> Background</strong> option from the toolbar. <p> Select the background color.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> If you want to add a custom image as the background, then add the image to the project, and then use the <strong> Text</strong> option to add the title or content you want.</p> <h3> Adding audio</h3> <p> The Photos app editor includes the ability to insert background music and custom audio (such as narration) to add some life to your video.</p> <h3> Background music</h3> <p> To add background music to your project, use these steps:</p> <p> Click the <strong> Background music</strong> button from the top-right corner.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Select the soundtrack you want to use. (You can click the triangle <strong> Play</strong> button to preview the music.)</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Check the <strong> Sync your video to the music's beat</strong> option. Set the music volume using the slider option. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> After you complete the steps, the soundtrack will adapt automatically to the full length of your video.</p> <h4> Custom audio</h4> <p> To add custom audio or narration to your video project, use these steps:</p> <p> Click the <strong> Custom audio</strong> button from the top-right corner.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Click the <strong> Add audio file</strong> button.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Select the audio track. <p> Click the <strong> Open</strong> button.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Use the controls on the left side to specify where the audio should play.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> Once you complete the steps, the narration or custom music track will apply to your project.</p> <p> If you need to add narration, you can use the Voice recorder app to create a recording that you can then import to the project.</p> <h3> Adding theme</h3> <p> Just like using the automatic video feature, you can also add a theme to restyle the video with filters, music, and text styles.</p> <p> To apply a theme to a video project, use these steps:</p> Click the <strong> menu</strong> (three-dotted) button from the top-right corner. <p> Select the <strong> Themes</strong> option.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> <p> Select a theme for the list.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Click the <strong> Play</strong> button to preview the changes. Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> After you complete the steps, the new theme will apply to the entire video, and you can preview it clicking the <strong> Play</strong> button in the preview section.</p> <p> </p> <h2> How to add 3D effects video project using Photos</h2> <p> Perhaps one of the most exciting features in the Photos app is 3D special effects that you can add to the media element.</p> <p> To add 3D effects to a video project, use these steps:</p> Open <strong> Photos</strong> .

Click the <strong> 3D library</strong> tab. <p> Select the library category.</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Select the element to add to the video. <p> Use the controls on the left side to drag and position the element in the clip. (You can also rotate and scale the effect using the controls.)</p> <p> <span> Source: Windows Central </span> </p> Use the controls to attach the element to an object in the video clip. So, even if the camera was moving during the recording, the 3D effect will stay in the correct place. (Optional) Use the <strong> Quick animations</strong> drop-down menu to select an animation (if applicable). Click the <strong> Done</strong> button. <p> Once you complete the steps, you'll end up with a more engaging clip using 3D effects.</p> <p> </p> <h2> How to backup video project using Photos</h2> <p> The Photos app video editor also allows you to backup a project so you can use it on another computer.</p> <p> To backup a video project in the Photos app, use these steps:</p> Open <strong> Photos</strong> .
