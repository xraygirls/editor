Darkroom can access your whole photo library at once, letting you immediately start cropping, adjusting curves and using preset filters or creating your own‚Äîuntil your pics are exactly how you want them.</p> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> CERDABOI </span> <span> , </span> 08/30/2019 <h3> Great features but unstable </h3> <p> Although there are no selective editing brushes, Darkroom is probably the only editor with this many editing tools that allows you to batch edit on mobile. The only thing that‚Äôs missing is some stability. It always crashes on my 5th gen iPad mini. The only things I would improve is the stability of app itself, the grain feature, because the grain gets wayyy to gritty, and a noise reduction feature. Honestly I think noise reduction would be more important than a selective brush. I could use Darkoom for event photo editing, where I barely finding myself using the selective brush, but then that leaves out a trusty noise reduction feature so I feel like it really limits my options when it comes to picking a project to edit with this app. I would still rather stick to doing the majority of my editing with Lightroom. This app came very close to opening up my workflow but that one feature of noise reduction missing is a deal breaker for me.</p> <h3> <span> Developer Response </span> <span> , </span> </h3> <p> We have been long at work resolving this issue and hope to ship the fix for it soon.</p> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> Brandon_219 </span> <span> , </span> 09/14/2019 <h3> Screenshots are pictures too </h3> <p> If I could add one advanced feature it would be spot-selected white balance, but I m content with the controls for the most part. If I could add one basic feature that really shouldn t be an issue, though, it d be to import screenshots. Why the hell are screenshots excluded? I have this near-perfect photo editor and can t edit 1/4 of my photos. I know screenshots aren t ideal for printing but they re good for testing crops and testing edits of photos, the latter I can t do without making copies of photos thanks to this app s strange limitation. Yes I can test edits on a single image but I would have to note and undo every edit to try the next. It just seems so much more inefficient than simply allowing screenshots to be edited.<br/> <br/> Edit: added one star. It s good that screenshots aren t completely excluded, but I still wish they appeared in albums like normal photos do. In an attempt to declutter, per developer s response, I feel like they ve actually created more clutter in making screenshots harder to navigate and cause needless frustration by making them disappear from albums they re in. If you want to declutter the normal camera roll, that s fine, but favorites and other albums should be left alone.</p> <h3> <span> Developer Response </span> <span> , </span> </h3> <p> Screenshots are there, we just hide theme to declutter. In the Album selector, pick the Screenshots Smart Album and browse and edit to your hearts content.</p> <h2> Information</h2> Seller Bergen Co.
